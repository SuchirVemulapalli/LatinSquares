# Normalized & Multiple Latin Square Generator

This algorithm is designed to print any nxn Normalized Latin Square. User input determines the order of the Latin Square. A Normalized Latin Square is a Latin Square that has 1 to N occuring in that specific order across the first row and across the first column. 

The program subsequently randomly (or pseudo-randomly) prints n! unique permutations of the Latin Square. 

The algorithm has additional functionality implemented to print up to the upper and lower bound of possible nxn Latin Squares since the exact number of Latin Squares for any n is not a solved problem.
