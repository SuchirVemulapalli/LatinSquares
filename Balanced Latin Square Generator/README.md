#Balanced Latin Square Generator

This algorithm prints any nxn Balanced Latin Square using C++. User input determines the order of the Latin Square and exits the program. 

A Balanced Latin Square is a Latin Square where a certain number X precedes another number Y exactly once when n is even. When n is odd, X will precede Y exactly twice. 

Balanced Latin Squares are especially important in clinical trials where each entry of the Latin Square can be interpreted as a treatment option. For example, a treatment option Z might only be performing badly because it's used after a certain sequence of treatment options. A Balanced Latin Square ensures that the every sequence of two treatment options occurs equally to prove the actual efficacy of each treament.
